**For GitHub Pages:**
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. In your repository, go to **Settings > Pages**.

## 🧠 My Journey

This project was a rewarding experience, filled with challenges and learning opportunities. Here's a memorable moment from the journey:

> **Memorable Moment**:  
> After implementing a carousel for the design using JavaScript, I pushed myself to explore all possible ways to achieve the same functionality using only HTML and CSS. However, I realized my design was unachievable with these methods. Adapting the design, I used this opportunity to create a static image set with a reveal element for the launch of a new character. Using hidden and hover effects to achieve this was fun and aligned well with the overall feel of the website.

> When having an issue with my hero button that wouldnt give the margin settings i had applied to the page, so instead of using !important in inline HTML i kept in CSS and finaly found: display:inline-block;. The enforced the margin and fixed the issue with it too clase to the above paragragh.

## 🧪 Test Section

### Internal Manual Testing

This section documents manual testing performed both in person and online. For the online portion, the website was uploaded and accessed via its live pages to verify functionality.

<div style="overflow-x:auto; font-size:1.15em;">

| Date       | Item                   | Function/Feature                    | Pass/Fail |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| 2025-05-16 | Discover Button        | Opens Facebook profile in new tab   | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Burger Menu            | Opens/closes navigation menu        | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Gallery Hidden Image   | Reveals image on hover/press        | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Pop-out Website Links  | Opens external sites in new tab     | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Video Controls         | Play/pause/mute video               | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Features Table         | Responsive, headers above content   | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Form Button            | Submits contact form                | Fail      |
| 2025-05-16 | Mobile Responsiveness  | Layout adapts to mobile devices     | Pass      |

> **Note:**  
> The "Form Button" test failed because the HTML5 feature used for form submission is not supported by GitHub Pages, resulting in an error. This functionality will work as intended when the site is uploaded to a personal web hosting provider that supports server-side form handling.
