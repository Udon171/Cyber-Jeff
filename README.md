## 🧠 My Journey

This project was a rewarding experience, filled with challenges and learning opportunities. Here's a memorable moments from the journey:

> **Memorable Moments**:  
> After implementing a carousel for the design using JavaScript, I pushed myself to explore all possible ways to achieve the same functionality using only HTML and CSS. However, I realized my design was unachievable with these methods. Adapting the design, I used this opportunity to create a static image set with a reveal element for the launch of a new character. Using hidden and hover effects to achieve this was fun and aligned well with the overall feel of the website.

> When having an issue with my hero button that wouldnt give the margin settings I had applied to the page, so instead of using !important in inline, I kept in CSS and finaly found: display:inline-block;. This enforced the margin and fixed the issue with it too close to the above paragragh.

## 🧪 Test Section

### Internal Manual Testing

This section documents manual testing performed both in person and online. For the online portion, the website was uploaded and accessed via its live pages to verify functionality.

<div style="overflow-x:auto; font-size:1.15em;">

| Date       | Item                   | Function/Feature                    | Pass/Fail |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| 2025-05-16 | Discover Button        | Opens Facebook profile in new tab   | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Burger Menu            | Opens/closes navigation menu        | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Gallery Hidden Image   | Reveals image on hover/press        | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Pop-out Website Links  | Opens external sites in new tab     | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Video Controls         | Play/pause/mute video               | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Features Table         | Responsive, headers above content   | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Form Button            | Submits contact form                | Fail      |
| 2025-05-16 | Mobile Responsiveness  | Layout adapts to mobile devices     | Pass      |
| 2025-05-16 | Large Display Responsiveness | Layout adapts to large screens/desktops | Pass      |


> **Note:**  
> The "Form Button" test failed because the HTML5 feature used for form submission is not supported by GitHub Pages, resulting in an error. This functionality will work as intended when the site is uploaded to a personal web hosting provider that supports server-side form handling.

## 🧩 UX Review

### Usability
Cyber Jeff is designed for intuitive navigation, with clear sectioning and a prominent burger menu for mobile users. Buttons and links are clearly labeled, and interactive elements provide visual feedback on hover or tap.

### Performance
The site uses optimized images and minimal external dependencies to ensure fast load times. CSS media queries and efficient layout choices help maintain smooth performance across devices and resolutions.

### Accessibility
Semantic HTML is used throughout, with proper heading structure and ARIA labels where appropriate. Color contrast meets WCAG standards, and navigation is accessible via keyboard. All images include descriptive alt text.

### Functionality
All core features—including navigation, video playback, gallery reveals, and external links—work as intended. The features table adapts responsively, and all interactive elements are tested for reliability. The contact form is present but requires server-side support for full functionality.

### Design Consistency
A unified color palette, consistent typography, and repeated UI patterns (such as button styles and card layouts) ensure a cohesive visual experience. Responsive breakpoints maintain this consistency across all device sizes.

### User Feedback
Interactive elements (buttons, links, gallery images) provide immediate visual feedback on hover, focus, or tap. Error messages are displayed for invalid form submissions, and successful interactions are visually confirmed.

### Mobile Experience
The layout adapts seamlessly to mobile devices, with touch-friendly controls, readable font sizes, and a collapsible navigation menu. Images and tables are optimized for smaller screens, ensuring no horizontal scrolling is required.

### Error Handling
Form validation is implemented for required fields, and users are notified if submission fails (e.g., due to unsupported server-side processing on GitHub Pages). Broken links and missing resources are minimized through thorough testing.
