## 🧠 My Journey

This project was a rewarding experience, filled with challenges and learning opportunities. Here's a memorable moment from the journey:

> **Memorable Moment**:  
> After implementing a carousel for the design using JavaScript, I pushed myself to explore all possible ways to achieve the same functionality using only HTML and CSS. However, I realized my design was unachievable with these methods. Adapting the design, I used this opportunity to create a static image set with a reveal element for the launch of a new character. Using hidden and hover effects to achieve this was fun and aligned well with the overall feel of the website.
